This is not a complete list as I am still building it. I should note that I prefer books to courses so I am more knowledgeable about them. Notice that for the books, there are a lot more books than just pure machine learning as most of at least my day to day is not pure machine learning. 

# Recommended Books
## <b>[Build a Career in Data Science (Emily Robinson & Jacqueline Nolis)](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-career-in-data-science)</b><br>
<img src='/images/buildcareerdatascience.png' width="258" height="325">

Benefits: 
* Good career advice for different types of jobs and companies
* Underrated interview questions in the book
* Good advice on different data science projects
* Good knowledge of how to build a portfolio
* Mentions my blog post, ["How to Build a Data Science Portfolio"](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-data-science-portfolio-5f566517c79c)

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* It talks about self learning a bit or learning on the job which is probably not super realististic.


## <b>[Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD (Jeremy Howard & Sylvain Gugger)](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527)</b><br>
<img src='/images/deeplearningforcoders.jpg' width="254" height="332">

Benefits:
* Heard good things. Haven't read it yet. 

## <b>[Deep Learning with Python (François Chollet)](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Python-Francois-Chollet/dp/1617294438)</b><br>
<img src='/images/deeplearningwithpythonFrancoisChollet.jpg' width="266" height="333">

Benefits:
* Written by François Chollet, creator of Keras
* Massively popular book
* First edition already out, second edition will be out in the Summer 2021 (I have seen some of the early chapters and they are really good)

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* In late 2018, Keras and TensorFlow became more attached to each other. The first edition was published before that. 

## <b>[Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow (Aurélien Géron)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1492032646/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)</b><br>
<img src='/images/Hands-On_MachineLearning.png' width="252" height="337">

Benefits:
* Reading this now

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* No negatives yet. 

## <b>[Introduction to Computation and Programming using Python (John V. Guttag)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python-second-edition)</b><br>
<img src='/images/IntroductionComputationProgrammingPython.jpg' width="183" height="231">

Benefits: 
* Python book which goes over object oriented programming, algorithmic complexity, data structures, and statistics
* I like the distribution and confidence interval part of the book (even though its a small section)

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* Not super useful for data science, but algorithmic complexity and data structures appear in interviews!
* Uses pylab for some examples and calculates standard deviation from scratch. While this isn't a deal breaker, it can be confusing for some students. 

## <b>[Introduction to Machine Learning with Python (Andreas C. Muller & Sarah Guido)](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Machine-Learning-Python-Scientists/dp/1449369413)</b><br>
<img src='/images/introductionToMachineLearningWithPython.jpg' width="190" height="249">

Benefits: 
* Very good machine learning introduction for visual learners (The author put a lot of time into making images for the book, this is not a common thing)
* Book gives intuitive explanation of how algorithms work 
* Authors are big in the machine learning community

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* First edition published in 2016 so I would like a second edition, but the book is still relevant
* Not a lot of math (in case you want to dive deep into it)

## <b>[Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Christopher M. Bishop)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387310738)</b><br>
<img src='/images/patternrecognitionmachinelearning.jpg' width="246" height="333">

Benefits: 
* Very good machine learning theory with relatively intuitive math

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* Book published in 2006 so probably needs some updating
* You need to know linear algebra and calculus to understand a lot of the book

## <b>[Python Data Science Handbook (Jake VanderPlas)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do)</b><br>
<img src='/images/pythondatasciencehandbook.png' width="252" height="333">

Benefits:

* Read the book in its entirety online at [https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)
* Book is constantly updated online

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* The machine learning part is too basic

## <b>[Python Machine Learning (Sebastian Raschka & Vahid Mirjalili)](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-scikit-learn-TensorFlow/dp/1789955750/)</b><br>
<img src='/images/pythonMachineLearning.jpg' width="202" height="257">

Benefits: 
* TensorFlow/Keras/Scikit-Learn based
* Machine Learning to Deep Learning explanations are pretty good
* Nice images supporting concepts
* Published in late 2019 with the author constantly updating the book's code

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* I dont like the initial explanation of deep learning relative to other sources in this list

## <b>[The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie & Tibshirani & Friedman)](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Prediction-Statistics/dp/0387848576)</b><br>
<img src='/images/elementsStatisticalLearning.jpg' width="222" height="333">

Benefits: 
* Great statistical theory for a lot of basic machine learning algorithms
* I like the section on wide data (p bigger than n).

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* Uses R for examples 

# Recommended Courses

# Haven't Looked at, but Heard Good Things
I will take these at some point to see how they are.
