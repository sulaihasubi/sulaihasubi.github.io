üë©üèª‚Äçüî¨ What I Possess as a Data Scientist
---
<p style="text-align:justify">
Personally, domain knwoledge and the ability to learn on the fly really far more valuable than on a book understanding of machine learning algorithms. The good things I possess as a Data Scientist in RiseHill are:-
</p>

<ul style="text-align:justify">
  <li>The ability to built robustly simple models that generalise effectively on out-of-sample data.</li>
  <li>Machine Learning models not always or must be a complicated model</li>
  <li>Capability and desire to express complex issues in a simple and transparent manner</li>
  <li>Be detailed oriented and understanding on how to drive a business competitive</li>
  <li>Be a strong analytical thinker with problem-solving and presentation skills</li>
</ul>


üë©üèº‚Äçüíº My Background
---
<p style="text-align:justify">
My name is Sulaiha Subi, you may call me <strong>"Sue"</strong> for short. I am <strong> Data Scientist </strong> at a startup company in Kuala Lumpur with industry experience in Data Science, Deep Learning and Machine Learning. I joined the company as the first Data Scientist working on every aspect of Data Analytics and Predictive Modelling. I am the main contributor to the development of Data Science in the company.
My other big responsibilities as Data Scientist are to develop new client relationships or potential collaboration, meet & present the company's product/services & highly responsible to prepare high business value commercial proposals across different domains of the industries (client-facing skills). </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
I also currently collaborating with 47 other AI Engineer from 18 countries for 8 weeks challenge as a <strong>Machine Learning Engineer</strong> (part-timer) at Omdena. In this project I apply my knowledge and skills to build an automated plant health prediction model, using drone-derived multispectral and thermal data combined with weather and irrigation data. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
I am proficient in Python (Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV) programming language and data visualisation with Tableau and Dataiku. I am enjoyed working with large datasets including cleaning, preprocessing, connecting and mining those data. I have alredy worked with few high value use case in Insurance, Marketing and Edge Computing like Drone where I built Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Regression and Image Classifiaction. Some of these model developed end-to-end in Dataiku DSS Platform. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Projects I worked on include Text Pre-processing for NLP in the documents management system, Integrated Data Intelligence (IDI), and applied cutting-edge Computer Vision skills  for POC in face recognition & counting for productivity measurements. More details about this project can be found here:

üìà My Journey to Data Science
---
<p style="text-align:justify">
As an undergraduate in Information System, a unique program that focus on both technical and managerial aspects. During my studies as undergraduate, there are few subjects in IS like Intelligence System, Data Mining, Data Visualisation and Collective Intelligence (NLP like Text & Speech Processing) that encourage me to pursue more in Data Science.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
After graduation in 2019, in 2020 I continue to pursue my Data Science journey by taking Deep Learning Certification (Junior Deep Learning Engineer) and one month training  which covered in-depth study of data pipelines and deep learning model development from deploying deep learning to production. 
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
Along the way of my journey become Data Scientist (current role), I developed my skills in Data Science for Marketing as Digital Marketer (Analysing Marketing Data), I became part time apprentice which is deep learning infrastructure development and then I joined IoT Company at Cyberjaya as Software Engineer where I worked with IoT engineer, to perform and design testing protocols/prototypes to ensure that the product is fully tested
before the deployment. Not limited to that, I actively encouraging myself to collaborate in solving real-world project as Machine Learning Engineer. 
</p> 

<p style="text-align:justify">
I dreamed about predicting the future using past data & wanted to be a part in Data Analytics Team - before all the hype around data science. Therefore in 2020, I decided to fulfill my dream to move from Labuan to Kuala Lumpur and become a Data Scientist.
</p>

üìä My Data Science Skills
---
<p style="text-align:justify">
I have for one and half years experinced in Data Science. I already built few end-to-end <strong>Machine Learning Models & Predictive Analytics Projects</strong> based on real-world problems. 
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
Having a background in Computer Science allows me to learn faster and quickly adapt into the trends of technology. The experience that I acquired through out this years are:-
</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify">
